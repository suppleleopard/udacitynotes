How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Diff make it pretty quick to spot the added and removed file which highlighted the typo and thus remove the bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    To see if someone else changed something along the way

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   Well each version can be a particular state of readiness. Autosave has no knowledge of where you are in YOUR workflow

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Programming is based on linked files. Docs are discrete items.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   Log shows all version, diff shows the difference between 2 files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can try anything out safe in the knowledge you can undo

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   Development
